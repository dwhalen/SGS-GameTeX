In LaTeX, when compiling fails, the last couple of lines of the console output can be used to diagnose exactly what went wrong.  Here are a couple of common problems, with easy solutions.  In general "game" should be replaced with whatever your game class name is.


1) Failed to find game.cls (replace game.cls with your game's name)
Output:
	! LaTeX Error: File `game.cls' not found.
Problem:
	LaTeX doesn't know where to look for game.cls, which is in the LaTeX directory.  You need to tell LaTeX exactly where game.cls can be found.
Solution:
	There are a couple of things you can do depending on your operating system and tex IDE.
	In certain distributions of LaTeX, you can use the --include-directory "<path to LaTeX> directory" in the pdflatex command, or ask your TeX IDE to use this command for you.
	Copy game.cls and game_path.cls into the Production directory.
	In Windows, Linux, and OS, you can include the path to your LaTeX directory in your TEXINPUTS environment variable.
	You can run the pdflatex command from the LaTeX directory in the terminal.
	

2) Failed to find the path file
Output:
	! I can't find file `${game}/LaTeX/gametex.sty'.
Problem:
	The game path isn't currently defined, so LaTeX doesn't know where to look for the game's files
Solution:
	Define the environment variable $game using setenv as described in the README or create a new file in the same directory as game.cls named game.path with the contents: 
	\edef\gamepath{"<path to base directory without spaces or backslashes>"}


3) Missing Brackets
Output:
	! Use of \cTest doesn't match its definition.
Problem:
	Macros need to end with braces, even if they have no arguments.
Solution:
	Replace "\cTest" with "\cTest{}".


4) Missing/Misspelled Macro
Output:
	! Undefined control sequence.
	\MYitems -> \iTedt
				{}\nTest{}
Problem:
	The macro before the line break (\iTedt in this example), is misspelled or has not been defined.
Solution:
	Correct the spelling of the macro or define it in the appropriate location.
